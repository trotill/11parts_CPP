## 11parts RealTime C++ core 
Framework 11-parts (eleven parts) for the development of complexes and devices based on Linux OS.
This repository contains a high-speed multi-threaded server that is part of the 11-parts framework. All code of this repository is written in C++

The assembly instructions for the project are not ready, the source codes are presented for informational purposes only. In addition to the instructions, a start-up project is also required, it is not here either, it is not ready.
